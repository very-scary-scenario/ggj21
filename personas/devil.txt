#Intro1 (pick one line from each Intro section at random)
Hell of a day, right, human?
Well I'll be damned, it's the Lost and Found booth.

#Intro2
It's the damnedest thing, but I've somehow lost something.
I can't figure out where the Hell I put my <object>.

#Intro3
I'm just hoping to hell that you have it back there!

#OutroPositive1
Hell yes, that is mine.
Yes! YEEEEES! This is my <object>!

#OutroPositive2
It may not mean much these days, but I'll put in a good word for you with those guys upstairs.
I'll make sure you suffer slightly less than for eternity for your assistance.

#OutroNegative1
Are you aware of the fate which means those who dare to mock me?
You anger me, human.

#OutroNegative2
Keep your damn mortal goods, I shall be claiming your soul for eternity soon enough.
You have just signed yourself up for double-suffering.
I would like to see the manager.

#OutroNoItem1
DAMN IT! DAMN IT ALL!
Curses!

#OutroNoItem2
Fear not, Mortal, for it is not you who has claimed my wrath this day.
Do not be afraid, for it is not you who will suffer in the depths of my flames this day.

#Weight
Much like how the sin for your villainy weights on your soul, it is of a <weight> weight.
#Size
Compared to the suffering of my 'customers', it is but <size>.
#ColourPositive
It is a most violent shade of <colour_1>, much like the kind of violence that would land you in my care.
#ColourNegative
It is the same colour as the Sin of a Saint, which is to say, it's quite boringly colourless.
#FlammablePositive
Yes, it ignites within the flames of Hell and powered the suffering of the damn for all eternity!
#FlammableNegative
No, flammable items are something of a fire hazard around my abode!
#LivingPositive
Yes, it is living. For now.
#LivingNegative
It is without life.
#EdgesPositive
It has edges to cut and sting more than a thousand paper cuts.
#EdgesNegative
No, it is an item without edges.
#DensityPositive
It is as dense as the sin piled upon the soul of any British Politician. Yes, even that one.
#DensityNegative
It is not particularly dense, no.
#Feel
It feels so <feel> that placing it just outside the reach of my 'guests' drives them insane.
#EdiblePositive
It's as edible as the donuts with which I overfill the bellies of those that lived a gluttonous existance.
#EdibleNegative
I would not recommend it to the living.
#Value
It is the most <value> item in all of Hell.
#Temperature
It's about as hot as Hell is these days. You know, <temperature>.
#RecyclablePositive
Yes, even I believe in recycling. Just maybe not that 'reincarnation' stuff.
#RecyclableNegative
No, it is not for recycling, for it shall stay with me for all eternity!
#Mouthfeel
Mouthfeel? With these questions, I feel I shall be seeing you when your time comes. I would guess it is <mouthfeel>.
#BlendPositive
Yes, it is of a blendable quality.
#BlendNegative
It will not blend, and I even tried to use one of the fancy ones we keep for, shall we say, 'business purposes'
#Shape
Much like the soul of the average mortal, it is somewhat of a <shape> shape.
#CustomsPositive
The only people who would try to take this through Customs are those which would seek to visit me in Hell at their passing.
#CustomsNegative
No, this item would not bear a weight upon ones soul.
#MagneticPositive
Yes, this item will cling to metal as ones evil deeds causes sin to cling to ones mortal soul.
#MagneticNegative
No. What kind of question even is that?
