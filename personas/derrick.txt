#Intro1 (pick one line from each Intro section at random)
Yoooooooooooooooo please help.
Hay hay hay! I mean, hey hey hey!
What's up!

#Intro2
Crazy thing right, my <object> went missing around here. Have you got it?
<object|sentence>. Ring any bells?
Can you do us a solid and see if you've got my <object>.

#Intro3
If you've got it, please give it me back. I'm losing my marbles here. Oh, metaphor, not looking for those as well.
I could do with you checking quickly, I've got a date tonight.
Please be quick, I'm on the run.

#OutroPositive1
Yesssss that's exactly right!
Thank you so much! This helps me so much!
This is one hundred percent what I'm after. I'm so happy I used words instead of numbers!

#OutroPositive2
I've gotta go. Thanks again.
You have a great one now, I'm gonna leave you a 5 star review.

#OutroNegative1
Hey hey hey come on now that's not even close to being right.
Yes that's...wait...no that's not it at all. What are you even doing?
0 out of 10.

#OutroNegative2
I'm leaving a really bad review you know. I'm out of here.
See you never and thanks for nothing.

#OutroNoItem1
Well, was worth a shot. Thanks anyway.
Really? Not even in the back?

#OutroNoItem2
Well, I'll be off then. Thanks anyway.
I'll stop hanging around and see what I can find. Thanks.

#Weight
Uhhhhhh maybe <weight>? I think?

Definitely <size>. That should be obvious.
#ColourPositive
It's <colour_1>, but they're <colour_2> that colour.
#ColourNegative
Uhhhhh pass.
#FlammablePositive
Not like I've tried, but yes it is.
#FlammableNegative
The only thing fire here is me.
#LivingPositive
I sure hope so.
#LivingNegative
It is not. Not any mor-I mean no never.
#EdgesPositive
It has more edges than an angry echidna.
#EdgesNegative
No...not really edgy.
#BuoyancyPositive
Yes, like a globetrotting duck!
#BuoyancyNegative
No, not really. Like a hammer, straight to the bottom.
#Feel
I'd describe it as <feel>. Please don't judge me.
#EdiblePositive
Well, yes you can eat it, but please don't. It's mine.
#EdibleNegative
I wouldn't want to try and eat it to be honest. Both in terms of edibility and in terms of don't. 
#Value
It's <value>, but I didn't tell you that.
#Temperature
Lovely and <temperature> as long as you've been treating it right.
#RecyclablePositive
If it wasn't mine, yes. However, it's mine, so don't.
#RecyclableNegative
If it wasn't mine, no. Since it's mine, also no.
#Mouthfeel
...I don't think I've ever put it in my mouth. Maybe <mouthfeel>? That sounds about right.
#BlendabilityPositive
Yes it can. So can your hand.
#BlendabilityNegative
No, but your hand can. Choose carefully.
#Shape
It is <shape>-shaped, as you should expect.
#CustomsPositive
Yeah, customs would take it off me, but I have a license.
#CustomsNegative
No, I have the right to bear <object>s. Customs shouldn't bat an eyelid.
#MagneticPositive
Well, yeah it's magnetic. Of course it is. That might help you find it quicker.
#MagneticNegative
Nope, though that could be fun.
