#Intro1 (pick one line from each Intro section at random)
Hi-hi!
Hello there!

#Intro2
I was hoping you can help me.
I may not look like it, but I'm actually an expert in Intergalactic Space Physics. That said...

#Intro3
I've lost my <object>!
I've lost something, and I'm hoping you can help me.
I need some help!

#OutroPositive1
Oh my gosh, it's my <object>!
Thank you so much!!!
There it is! It's my <object>.

#OutroPositive2
You are an absolutely star!
Five out of Five, great service!
Thank you so much!

#OutroNegative1
Ummm, I'm pretty sure this isn't mine.
Emmm, I was looking for a <object>?
Nope, Nopers, Noperific.

#OutroNegative2
I'm highly disappointed in you.
I shall be filing a complaint.

#OutroNoItem1
Ack! I guess I'm out of luck!
Oh, rats and a turkey.
Awwwww....

#OutroNoItem2
Thanks for looking though.
Sorry for taking up your time.
Thank you for looking.

#Weight
Using all my scientific knowledge, I've estimate that it's... pretty <weight>.
#Size
Hmmm, subtract the... carry the... Ah, yes, it's <size>!
#ColourPositive
Oh, it's <colour_1>. Statistically, that's <colour_2> the case.
#ColourNegative
I'm not sure how to explain this with science, but it's... colourless?
#FlammablePositive
Oh, yes, it's very flammable. I only use it in secure lab conditions!
#FlammableNegative
It didn't burn last time I tried, anyway.
#LivingPositive
If you looked up the word 'living' in a dictionary, you'd find a picture of this. Well, not really, dictionaries don't often have pictures.
#LivingNegative
Hahahaha, I'm not sure that even a science novice would mistake this for living. 
#EdgesPositive
From my observational data, I'd say that yes, it has edges.
#EdgesNegative
All evidence points to "no".
#DensityPositive
It sank under lab conditions, last time I checked.
#DensityNegative
It's pretty 'floaty', as we say in the business.
#Feel
I believe the scientific term for this is that it feels somewhat <feel>.
#EdiblePositive
Scientifically, it's edible. It's nutritional value is hotly contested, though.
#EdibleNegative
I mean, maybe if you try hard enough, but not really.
#Value
It's extremely <value>.
#Temperature
Having tested this previously with the proper equipment, I would say that it is pretty <temperature>.
#RecyclablePositive
My studies into climate science would suggest that you should endeavour to recycle this, yes.
#RecyclableNegative
This needs to go into the landfill, alas.
#Mouthfeel
Urrrr, Mouthfeel isn't really a proper metric? I mean, I suppose <mouthfeel>?
#BlendPositive
Yes. Please don't ask me if I've tried it, though.
#BlendNegative
No. Please don't ask me if I've tried it, though.
#Shape
It's <shape>-shaped.
#CustomsPositive
It might be a little questionable from a customs point of view, but it's extremely important for science!
#CustomsNegative
Nope, nothing to be concerned about.
#MagneticPositive
I can assure you that it will attach to seven different types of metal, including Astroluminum blends!
#MagneticNegative
Nope, I can assure you that it is not magnetic.
