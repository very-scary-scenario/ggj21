#Intro1
Hello citizen, I'm famous fashion model Helmut Kruger.
Hello, I was wondering if you could help me tie up a loose end.
Greetings. I need to find something before I make a rapid exit.

#Intro2
Someone has misplaced my <object> and I need to retrieve it.
I've been assigned to retrieve the <object> with as little fuss as possible.
Retrieving the <object> is one of my mission objectives.

#Intro3
I'm hopeful you will be able to aid me in reaching my objective.
I trust that you will be able to help me execute my search.

#OutroPositive1
Flawless execution.

#OutroPositive2
Your service was to die for.

#OutroNegative1
Truly poisonous service.

#OutroNegative2
I shall be recommending you for an ICA contract.

#OutroNoItem1
Disappointing.

#OutroNoItem2
I see your glass is half empty.

#Weight
I would say <object> is <weight>.
#Size
If you put a gun to my head I would say <object> is <size>.
#ColourPositive
While I prefer blood red, I would say <object> is more of a <colour> shade.
#ColourNegative
I'm afraid that <object> is a colourless as a ghost.
#FlammablePositive
<object|sentence> is extremely flammable, trust me.
#FlammableNegative
Unfortunately I have ruled out <object> being combustible.
#LivingPositive
I can confirm that <object> is alive...for the time being.
#LivingNegative
I'm afraid that <object> is not breathing. Trust me, I know these things.
#EdgesPositive
<object|sentence> definitely has a few edges on it. Could be dangerous.
#EdgesNegative
I can say that <object> is smooth and blunt, much like a blackjack.
#BuoyancyPositive
<object|sentence> would definitely float, like a corpse in a pool.
#BuoyancyNegative
<object|sentence> would sink like a body weighed down with concrete.
#Feel
If I were not wearing leather gloves I would say it is <feel>.

<object|sentence> can be eaten, along with a variety of additives.

<object|sentence> cannot be consumed by anybody who wishes to remain amongst the living.

Like most good tools, <object> can be used for multiple targets.
#RecyclableNegative
I am afraid <object> is very much a one-time only use.
#Mouthfeel
If forced to consume it I would say it is <mouthfeel>.
#BlendabilityPositive
If it were to...accidentally fall into a blender, I am sure nothing would remain.
#BlendabilityNegative
Sadly even the sharpest of blades will have no effect on this object.
#Shape
I make a habit of recognising items by their silhouettes and can say this object is <shape>.
#CustomsPositive
I would prefer that <object> not attract the attention of the authorities.

I am satisfied that the authorities can inspect <object> and find nothing untoward.

I make it a habit to use items that can pass safely through magnetic scanners.
